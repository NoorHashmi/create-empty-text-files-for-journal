# create-empty-text-files-for-journal
This program creates empty text files, one for each day of the year. These text files can be used to write journal entries each day.

-----------------------------------------------------
Motivation For This Program:
-----------------------------------------------------
- I have kept physical journals for years.
- Recently moved to digital formats. Plus points are: text easy to maintain, reproduce and edit. It help in putting some writings on public blogs.
- Still haven't found a fast, reliant software to keep journal.
- Window's Notepad is simple, fast, readily available.
- To mimic the physical journal, where each day is assigned a page, I assign one text file to each day. File is named with date format (YYYY MM DD)
- I need to create 365 text files, named with appropriate dates, to create a "Digital Journal" for one year.
- Wrote this python script to do just that.
